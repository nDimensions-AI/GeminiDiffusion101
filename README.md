## ‚ú® About The Project

This project presents a detailed, interactive story that explains the key innovations in AI. It follows a chronological narrative, highlighting the problems that led to new architectures and the breakthroughs that solved them.

This tutorial is designed as a simple, single-file web application for easy sharing, viewing, and learning. It's built to be clean, intuitive, and inspired by Google's Material Design principles.

### Key Features:

* **Interactive Slideshow:** A step-by-step journey through 18 key milestones in the history of AI model architecture.
* **Google Material Design:** A clean, modern, and intuitive user interface.
* **Fully Responsive:** Works beautifully on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Runs directly in any modern web browser with no setup required.

## üöÄ Getting Started
